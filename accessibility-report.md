## Principles of Universal Design

**Equitable Use**:
- Our program ensures equitable use by providing a consistent user experience regardless of the user's gender or sexual orientation.
- Future enhancements could include accessibility features such as screen reader support to ensure that visually impaired users can also use the application effectively.

**Flexibility in Use**:
- The program allows users to interact with it in multiple ways, such as liking or disliking profiles and sending messages, catering to different user preferences.
-  We could implement customizable user interfaces to further enhance flexibility, allowing users to adjust the layout and appearance according to their needs.

**Simple and Intuitive Use**:
- The user interface (we utilise a dashboard to navigate users to different functionality) is designed to be straightforward, with clear labels and easy navigation, making it intuitive for users to find and use features like viewing matches and managing request.
- Future improvements could include guided tutorials for new users to help them understand how to use the application effectively.

**Perceptible Information**:
- The program uses clear text and icons to convey information, ensuring that users can easily understand the available options and actions.
- We could add alternative text for images and icons to support users who rely on screen readers.

**Tolerance for Error**:
- The application includes confirmation dialogs for critical actions, such as deleting a match, to prevent accidental data loss.
- Future features could include an undo option for certain actions to further reduce the impact of user errors.

**Low Physical Effort**:
- The program requires minimal physical effort to navigate and use, with most actions achievable through simple clicks or taps.
- We could implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions to reduce the need for mouse or touchpad use.

**Size and Space for Approach and Use**:
- The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works well on various screen sizes and devices.
- Future enhancements could include customizable font sizes and button spacing to accommodate users with different physical needs.

## Target Users
If we were to market our program, we would target young adults (especially university students) and professionals who are looking for meaningful connections and relationships. 
This demographic is likely to be tech-savvy and comfortable using online platforms for social interactions. 
Additionally, we would focus on individuals who are busy, look for efficient dating, value compatibility and personalized matchmaking, as our program emphasizes these aspects through its weighting and matching algorithms.

## Demographic Considerations
Our program may be less likely to be used by older adults or individuals who are not comfortable with technology. 
This could be due to a lack of familiarity with online dating platforms or a preference for traditional methods of meeting people. 
Additionally, users with disabilities might face challenges if the program does not fully support accessibility features. To address these potential barriers, we could implement more inclusive design practices and provide comprehensive support and tutorials to help all users navigate and use the application effectively.
